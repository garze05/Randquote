# Randquote

A random, personalized inspirational quote generator written in JavaScript for Node.js.

## Features

- On the first run, you'll be asked for your name and interests.
- Every run after that will display a personalized inspirational quote based on your previous answers.
- You can update your answers at any time.

## Installation and Usage

1. Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed on your machine.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/garze05/Randquote.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project folder and run:

   ```bash
   node randquote
   ```

4. **Optional:** To update your information later, run `randquote` with the `s` or `start` argument:

   ```bash
   node randquote s
   node randquote start
   ```

   Both commands will have the same effect. You’ll be prompted to re-enter your user information.
